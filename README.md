# LearnOpenGL

This repository is dedicated to the study and practice of graphics programming using OpenGL. It is based on the tutorials available at [LearnOpenGL.com](https://learnopengl.com/), which provide a comprehensive approach to learning modern OpenGL, covering everything from basic concepts to advanced techniques.

## Project Structure

- **shaders/**: Contains the shaders used in the examples.
- **solutions/**: Includes the implemented solutions for the proposed exercises.
- **main.cpp**: The main file that runs the examples and demonstrations.

## Dependencies
